# Exercise 2
## Pointers


1.  Read `stack.c`, which should be in this directory.  What is it
intended to do?  What would the output be if the program worked as
expected?

It looks like it is intended to print "42" five times. The output would be
```
42
42
42
42
42
```

2.  Compile it.  Do you get a warning?  What does it mean?

```
warning: function returns address of local variable
```
It means that `foo()` returns the address of the array, but the array is a local variable so the main function cannot access that address.

3.  Run it.  What happens?  You might get a segmentation fault, or you might get
some strange output.  Can you explain it?  You might find it
helpful to draw a stack diagram.

The output I get is
```
0
0
-981549440
32655
-981461712
```

4.  Comment out the `print` statements in `foo()` and `bar()` and run
it again.  What happens now?

5.  Add comments to the code to explain these experiments and the results,
then check the code in to the repo.

Moral: Don't return pointers to stack allocated data!
