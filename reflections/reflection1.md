# Reflection 1
## Sprint Reflection
I entered this class two weeks into the semester, so I pretty much spent none of sprint 1 with my team.  I did get caught up by going through HFC and TOS chapters 1 and 2.  From what I can tell, our team is still getting there with trying to implement eduScrum.  Our trello board is usually up-to-date, but not always, and the organization of it was confusing at first but I now understand it.  Learning C has been more difficult than I previously thought, as I have never really learning so much about lower-level languages and how a computer works.
## Head First C Exercises
This sprint I did HFC chapters [1](../exercises/ex01/), [2](../exercises/ex02/), and [2.5](../exercises/ex02.5/).
## Think OS Reading Questions
This sprint I did [TOS chapters 1 and 2](../reading_questions/thinkos.md).
## Exam Question
What does code optimization do, and what are the main advantages and disadvantages of it?

Code opimization is a step during compilation of code that can make the program faster or use less space.  Advantages are that your program can run faster if speed is important, and it can be less memory-heavy if space is important.  Disadvantages are that compiling takes longer, and it can make it harder to debug your code.
